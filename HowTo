How is 'ChatONLAN' gonna work?
So we need all the members who wanna chat connected on LAN, be a 'router'. Every member broadcasts their information on
the local network. This information is received by other members on the same network, and hence they know that there is
someone available on the network to chat.

This chat system is completely peer-to-peer, no server needed.

Broadcast
Broadcast is done using UDP protocol over another thread, users can disable broadcasting as per their wish.
The broadcast pushes a message in every 2 to 3 seconds on network.
If a member receives a broadcast message, it stores the information into its database.

Chat
So the idea is, that the user can double click on the members available online. When the user double clicks on the a name
a new tab is opened with the name of the member and the 'opened_chat_list' is updated. This opened_chat_list is used for
for easy checking and presenting message on the right tab.
